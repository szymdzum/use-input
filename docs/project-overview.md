# Project Overview

## Project Description
This project focuses on creating reusable React components for form handling with strict accessibility and maintainability requirements. The primary objectives include:

- Building an Inputs component system following atomic design principles
- Implementing robust form validation patterns
- Ensuring full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Creating reusable hooks for form state management

## Iterative Approach
Development follows a phased methodology:
1. Component prototyping
2. Validation system implementation
3. Accessibility integration
4. Documentation and testing

Each phase includes:
- Design validation with stakeholders
- Implementation sprints (2-3 days)
- Cross-browser testing
- Accessibility audits

## Key Deliverables
- Reusable Input component system
- Form validation hooks
- Documentation hub (this documentation)
- Automated accessibility test suite
